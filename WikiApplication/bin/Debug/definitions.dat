ArrayArrayLinear£An array is the data structure that stores a fixed number of literal values (elements) of the same data type. Array elements are stored contiguously in the memory.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-Linear¾Binary Search tree is a node-based binary tree data structure. Each tree node has a maximum of two children (left and right). The left child of a parent node will always have a smaller value compared to the parent node and the right child of the parent node will always have a larger value compared to the parent node.GraphGraphs
Non-LinearÒA graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes and a set of edges. The nodes can be referred as vertices and the edges as lines or arcs. Edges connect any two nodes in the graph. 
Hash TableHash
Non-LinearÖA hash table is a non-linear data structure where a collection of key/value pairs are arranged based on the hash code of the key. A hash table calculates the hash code of every key, storing it automatically in another location. Accessing the value means that the hash table at the time is going to match the hash code with the specified key. HeapTree
Non-LinearµA heap is a non-linear tree-based data structure in which each parent nodeâ€™s associated key value is greater than or equal to the key values of any of its childrenâ€™s key values.Linked ListListLinear§A linked list is a linear data structure which stores element in the non-contiguous location. The elements in a linked list are linked with each other using pointers meaning linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. ListListLinearÚA list is a linear data structure which is used to store objects or elements in the form of a list. The elements in a list can be accessed by index and it has methods for sorting, searching, and modifying the objects. QueueAbstractLinear³The Queue is non-generic collection class that stores the elements in first-in-first-out principle. Adding elements is called enqueuing and removing elements is called dequeuing. Self-Balance TreeTree
Non-LinearÑA self-binary search tree is a non-linear node-based binary search tree that always keeps its height as minimal as possible at all times. Self-balancing trees are used to construct and maintain ordered lists. SetAbstract
Non-Linear™A set is a non-linear data structure that stores unique values which are unordered and unindexed. A set is used to test a value of a membership in a set.StackAbstractLinearæA stack represents a linear data structure where elements are added using the last-in, first-out principle. The stack stores a collection of items in the linear order which means the item which is added last will be removed first.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinearÝA two-dimensional array stores elements in the form of rows and columns. The two-dimensional array is of two types  such as rectangular array (rows and columns are equal) and jagged array (rows and columns are not equal).
